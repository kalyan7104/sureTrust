    "    - display_info(): Prints employee details.\n",
    "\n",
    "Define a custom exception *InvalidSalaryIncrementException* that is raised when an invalid salary increment is provided.\n",

    "**Steps to Solve:**\n",
    "- Create an `Employee` class with the required attributes.\n",
    "- Define a custom exception `InvalidSalaryIncrementException`.\n",
    "- Implement the `promote(increment)` method that validates the increment before applying it.\n",
    "- Implement `display_info()` to show employee details.\n",
    "- Write a test case where a negative salary increment is attempted, and handle the exception gracefully.\n"
